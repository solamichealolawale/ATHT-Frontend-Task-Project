# ATHT Frontend Challenge

![Design preview for the challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Vuejs).**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page, integrate with our [Pay4me Dev API](https://dev.pay4me.app/docs/index.html) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries V2 API](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You can only use Vue/Nuxtjs as your JavaScript framework/library with either TailwindCSS (preferable)/Bootstrap. You also have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your task is to:
- Design the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Create a new login page and to make the login functional using the above API to an empty home page with successful message.
- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*


## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There are no assets for this challenge, as the country flags will be pulled from the [REST Countries V2 API](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2) and you can use an icon font library for the icons.


There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.


## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with us. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).

2. Configure or host your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will allow you to share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and here are some recommendations below.
  - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
  - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
 - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.

4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.

5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.

6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.


**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
